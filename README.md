I have changed some source codes so that Feature-dis can be tested on dataset Cifar10.

To run this code, you have to follow these three steps:

* 1. make a new directory named checkpoint/cifar10, and put a pre-trained network model file (wide-resnet-28x10.t7) in this new created directory.


* 2. make a new directory named data, and put data files of Cifar10 here.

* 3. run demo.sh
